## build过程
### 环境
1. 安装npm 下载地址：https://npm.taobao.org/mirrors/node/v10.14.1/node-v10.14.1-linux-x64.tar.gz，
```
tar -xzf node-v10.14.1-linux-x64.tar.gz
mv node-v10.14.1-linux-x64 node
```
2. 配置环境变量到.bashrc
```
export NODE_HOME=/home/jenkins/node  
export PATH=$NODE_HOME/bin:$PATH
```
3. 重新登录jenkins用户运行如下命令
```
npm install npm -g

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

npm run build<br />
打包项目<br />
打包完的项目为build文件夹<br />
项目就在根目录下<br />

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
